# Data Science/ Machine Learning Projects
This repository is to showcase my data science/machine learning projects. Each project uses a different dataset and different ML models to make predictions.

Some of the ipynb files are too big for GitHub to render, please use https://nbviewer.org/ to look at the projects if you cannot view the files.

They are as follows:

-Linear Regression for Boston Housing 

-K-Means Clustering for random dataset

-SVM for Breast Cancer Dataset

-ML models on Iris Dataset and their performance comparison

-ML models on Titanic Dataset and their performance comparison
