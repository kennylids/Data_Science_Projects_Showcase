# Data Science/ Machine Learning Projects
This repository is to showcase my data science/machine learning projects. Each project uses a different dataset and different ML models to make predictions.

They are as follows:

-Linear Regression for Boston Housing 
-K-Means Clustering for random dataset
-SVM for Breast Cancer Dataset
-ML models on Iris Dataset and their performance comparison
-ML models on Titanic Dataset and their performance comparison
